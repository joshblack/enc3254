# Writing Job-Application Materials

## Understanding the Job-Application Process

1. Plan the Job search
    - Learn as much as you can about potential employers and begin to plan your
      materials
2. Decide how to look for a position
    - Use resources such as college-placement offices, published ads, company
      web sites, etc.
3. Learn as much as you can about the organizaitons to which you will apply
4. Draft the resume and application letter
    - Decide whether to use a chronological or a skills resume
    - Decide whether to write a scannable resume
    - Write the letter to elaborate on key points from your resume
    - Include at least one paragraph about your job experience and one about
      your education
5. Revise, edit, and proofread the resume and letter
6. Prepare for job interviews
7. Write appropriate follow-up letters

## Planning the Job Search

When planning a job search you need to do the following:

1. *Do a self inventory*
    - Ask yourself questions such as *What are your strengths/weaknesses?* or
      *What subjects do you like?*
2. *Learn about the employers*
    - Learn about the organization through events like a job fair or further
      research into a company that interests you.
3. *Prepare a resume and a cover letter*
4. *Prepare a portfolio*
    - This shows your best work which can be either a variety of docs made in
      courses and previous positions or maybe graphics.

## Understanding the *eight* ways to look for a position

There are eight major ways to find a job:

1. Through a college or university placement office
2. Through a professional placement bureau
3. Through a published job ad
4. Through an organization's web site
5. Through a job board on the internet
6. Through your connecitons on social media
7. Through personal connections
8. Through an unsolicited letter to an organization
    - Before you write an unsolicited application, learn as much as you about
      the organization. 

## Writing Paper Resumes

You should write your own resume for three reason:

1. You know yourself better than anyone else does
2. Employment officers know the style of the local agencies
3. If you write your own resume, you will be more likely to adapt it to
   different situations

### Appearance of a resume

Your resume has to look professional. It should have all of the following:

- Generous margins
- Clear type
- Balance
- Clear organization

### Content of the Resume

Make sure you resume provides clear, specific information. It should also be
free of errors! 

There are two common resume styles: *chronological* and *skills*. In the former,
you use time to organize the page layout and you discuss your responsibilities
for each job you have had. In the latter you list your previous jobs and include 
  a skills sections describing your talents and achievements.

Since we're recent graduates we will most likely use the chronological style.

### Elements of the Chronological Resume

Chronological resumes have six basic elements:

1. Identify Information
    - Full name
    - Address
    - Phone Number
    - Email Address
2. Objectives or summary of qualifications
    - A *statement of objectives* is used by candidates new to the field. It
      offers a brief phrase that should do the following:
        - State the goals or duties mentioned for the position
        - Focusses on the readers needs
        - Is specific
3. Education
    - Degree
    - The institution
    - Location of the institution
    - Date of graduation
    - Information about other schools you've attended
4. Employment History
    - Provide basic information about each job you have held like dates of
      employment, organizaiton name, position or title. When describing what
      you've done at these jobs include some of the following factors:
        - What technical skills you used on the job
        - What kind of equipment did you operate on the job
        - How much money were you responsible for
        - What important documents did you write or assist in writing during
          your job
        - How many people did you supervise
        - What kind of clients you did business with
5. Interests and Activities
6. References

Other elements that you can include in your resume include:

- Computer Skills
- Military Experience
- Language Ability
- Willingness to relocate

### Elements of the Skills Resume

> A skills resume differs from a chronological resume in that it includes a 
separate section that emphasizes job skills and knowledge.

## Writing an Electronic Resume

An electronic resume can take on the following forms:

1. A formatted resume attached to an email message saved as `pdf` or `rtf`
2. A test resume `txt`
3. A scannable resume
4. A web based resume

### Content of the electronic resume

If the resume is to be entered into a database rather than read by a person,
make sure to include industry-specific jargon. Basically just include keywords,
or buzzwords, that the engine is looking for so that your resume doesn't get
rejected.

### Format of the Electronic Resume

- Use ASCII text only
- Left-align EVERYTHING
- Send yourself a test version of the resume

## Writing Job Application (Cover) letters

The keys to a good letter are *selectivity* and *development*. Select two or
three points of greatest interest and develop those into paragraphs. For most
candidates a job-application letter should fill the better part of a page.

### Elements of the Job-Application Letter

The inside address is important because you want to make sure that the materials
make it to the right person. You should follow *at least* a four paragraph
model. 

#### The Introductory Paragraph

- Identifies your source of information
- Identify the position you are interested in
- State the wish that you want to be considered for the position
- Forecast the rest of the letter

#### The Education Paragraph

For most students the education paragraph should come before the employment
paragraph because this section is stronger. 

#### The Employment Paragraph
